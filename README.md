### Project Title: Expense Tracker System

#### Introduction:
The Expense Tracker System is a C++ program designed to help users manage and track their expenses efficiently. The system allows users to record details of various expenses, view a summary of their expenditures, and store this information in a file for future reference.

#### Description:
The Expense Tracker System is implemented using a C++ program that utilizes object-oriented programming principles. It employs a class called `ExpenseTracker` to manage a collection of expenses, and each expense is represented by the `Expense` structure. The program provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface for adding expenses, viewing the expense list, and exiting the application.

#### Benefits:
1. **Easy Expense Management**: Users can effortlessly add and track their expenses in a structured manner.
2. **Time Efficiency**: The system automates the process of calculating total expenses, including delivery charges and date tracking.
3. **Data Persistence**: All recorded expenses are stored in a file ("expenses.txt"), allowing users to access their expense history across sessions.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The menu-driven interface makes the system accessible to users of varying technical expertise.

#### Process:
1. **Add Expense**:
   - Users can enter details such as client name, company name, product details, and more.
   - The system calculates the total expense, including delivery charges, based on user inputs.
   - The current date is automatically recorded for each expense.

2. **View Expenses**:
   - Users can view a comprehensive list of all recorded expenses.
   - The expense details are displayed in a tabular format, making it easy to understand.

3. **File Handling**:
   - The program reads and writes expense data to a file ("expenses.txt").
   - File handling ensures that expense records persist between different program executions.

#### Advantages:
1. **Accurate Expense Tracking**: The system provides accurate calculations for total expenses, reducing the chances of manual errors.
2. **Historical Data Access**: Users can refer to the expense history stored in the file at any time.
3. **Convenient Data Entry**: The program uses `getline` for text input, allowing users to enter detailed information comfortably.

#### Notes:
- The program uses a comma-separated values (CSV) format to store expense data in the file.
- Proper error handling is implemented for file operations and input validation.

#### Development:
The project is developed in C++ and leverages standard libraries for file handling and date manipulation. The use of structures and classes enhances code organization and readability.

#### Conclusion:
The Expense Tracker System provides a practical solution for individuals or businesses looking to efficiently manage and track their expenses. With a user-friendly interface and automated calculations, it simplifies the process of expense management, ensuring accuracy and data persistence.

This project serves as a foundation that can be extended with additional features, such as graphical interfaces, advanced reporting, or integration with external services for further utility.
